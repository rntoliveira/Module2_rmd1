## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](htttp://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* an another word in _italics_.

Whene compile our document, we are using `Rmarkdown` package.

Here some examples R commands:

```
a = 2
b = 3
mean(c(a,b))
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, xlab = "Temperatura (°C)", ylab = "Pressão (KPa/m²)")
```


## Insert tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top six rows of cars dataset")
```


## Insert equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 / \beta_1x $$
